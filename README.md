# EECS4461: AI Undercover

# Overview:

AI Undercover examines how AI gaming bots interact with AI cheat detection systems within digital games. The project examines both the manipulation tactics used by gaming bots to gain unfair advantages and the adaptive strategies employed by cheat detectors to neutralize these tactics. We run simulations to test AI systems across different scenarios including resource constraints and speed throttling with pattern recognition
