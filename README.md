# EECS4461: AI Undercover

# Overview:
A rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence systems transforms media ecosystems as well as redefines basic ways people interact digitally. AI systems and their detection technologies continuously confront each other in an ongoing battle which remarkably shows the shifting nature of technology. AI systems which interact with one another represent an operational pattern where intelligent programs create adaptive procedures that reply to changes made by other programs while they cause important digital security concerns.

The complex environment triggers AI cheating programs to create new detection evasion methods that push anti-cheat systems to develop countermeasures. The competitive nature of this system creates both technological complexity and severe consequences for user trust together with system reliability. Security precautions applied to extreme levels create problems for honest users while relaxed systems make it easier for players to cheat resulting in damages to virtual fairness principles.

Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) serves as the analysis method which uses virtual simulations to study self-ruled agents interacting in digital environments. Each agent receives colour designation according to their assigned role:
<br><br>
**Black agents:** represent regular human users, embodying the expected, rule-based behavior of typical online users.
**Blue agents:** represent the AI cheat detectors, whose role is to monitor and flag anomalous behaviors.
**Green agents:** represent cheaters, mimicking individuals or entities that deviate from normal behavior by exploiting vulnerabilities or engaging in unethical actions.
**Red agents:** represent cheaters that have been flagged by the system, transitioning from a green state upon detection.

System performance transformations emerge from minor parameter adjustments according to simulation evaluations that monitor vision radius and timeout threshold settings. The obtained insights serve as a basis for creating effective anti-cheating approaches and sustaining digital environment health.
