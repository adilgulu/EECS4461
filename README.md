# EECS4461: AI Undercover

# Overview:
A rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence systems transforms media ecosystems as well as redefines basic ways people interact digitally. AI systems and their detection technologies continuously confront each other in an ongoing battle which remarkably shows the shifting nature of technology. AI systems which interact with one another represent an operational pattern where intelligent programs create adaptive procedures that reply to changes made by other programs while they cause important digital security concerns.

The complex environment triggers AI cheating programs to create new detection evasion methods that push anti-cheat systems to develop countermeasures. The competitive nature of this system creates both technological complexity and severe consequences for user trust together with system reliability. Security precautions applied to extreme levels create problems for honest users while relaxed systems make it easier for players to cheat resulting in damages to virtual fairness principles.

Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) serves as the analysis method which uses virtual simulations to study self-ruled agents interacting in digital environments. Each agent receives colour designation according to their assigned role:
<br><br>
**Black agents:** represent regular human users, embodying the expected, rule-based behavior of typical online users.<br>
**Blue agents:** represent the AI cheat detectors, whose role is to monitor and flag anomalous behaviors.<br>
**Green agents:** represent cheaters, mimicking individuals or entities that deviate from normal behavior by exploiting vulnerabilities or engaging in unethical actions.<br>
**Red agents:** represent cheaters that have been flagged by the system, transitioning from a green state upon detection.

System performance transformations emerge from minor parameter adjustments according to simulation evaluations that monitor vision radius and timeout threshold settings. The obtained insights serve as a basis for creating effective anti-cheating approaches and sustaining digital environment health.

# Development Insights
Our model required advanced capabilities to match AI behavior patterns with gaming dynamics since AI behaviors needed simulation of basic operation while adapting automatically to AI cheating strategies and anti-cheating detection systems. A large number of simulation algorithm modifications and precision enhancements were needed to fulfill the simulation requirements.

The complexity of our project project required no alterations to either our planned model nor our original design methodology. Our team improved our strategic approach under existing parameters while working on development activities during production. The stable and consistent design and methodology framework protected our established simulation targets while safeguarding its outcome integrity.

# Looking Forward
Multiple scale-based obstacles presented the need for an advanced software solution that deals with intricate modeling requirements. The accurate assessment of AI strategies in digital ecosystems depends on our ability to address and overcome the encountered challenges since project success depends on it. Our barriers during this project will improve current work results and deliver important understanding for future simulations in advanced AI research.
